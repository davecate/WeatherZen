# WeatherZen

Bootcamp exercise: a fictional weather-tracking app, WeatherZen. 

Demonstrates the 'outside-in' fullstack workflow: first adding a single feature to a user interface, then building out the API of the feature, and lastly connecting the feature to a database. This allows new features to deploy quickly and responsively.

Uses React.js for front-end, Node/Express/Knex.js for API, and PostgreSQL/ElephantSQL/DBeaver for database management.

Feature: Users can add weather observations to the home screen by submitting their latitude, longitude, and general weather conditions.
